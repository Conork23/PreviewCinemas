            Preview Cinemas was a Web Application developed by Conor Keenan for his Third Year project in the National College of Ireland.
            The Web Application was developed using the asp.net MVC Framework.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Goal of this project was to design, develop and deploy a functional web application, using the asp.net framework. 
            This website incorporates a database to store information on the movies, showings, cinema screens, shopping cart and orders.
            Along with general information about customers and their accounts. 
            Some of this content was loaded into the database prior to deployment, but others such as orders and shopping cart will be generated by the users. 
            SOAP Based web services are added to the website to allow querying of the database.
